# Panthera_interview_gcm
This repo contains the code and static data used to create a [COVID-19 dashboard for South Africa]().
This was done as part of the interviewing process at Panthera.

### Data source
The Dynamic data for this project is sourced from the [Data Science for Social Impact Research Group](https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19za/tree/master/data).
A lot of insipiration was also taken from their own [dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/1b60bdc7-bec7-44c9-ba29-be0e043d8534/page/hrUIB).
The static data was obtained from [Stats SA](http://www.statssa.gov.za/).

### Notable statistics
On this dashboard we display multiple statistics that describe COVID-19.
The aim of the dashboard is to aid in travel decision making when travelling within South Africa.

Some notable statistics that we display are:
- Infection Probability Estimate (IPE) = A
